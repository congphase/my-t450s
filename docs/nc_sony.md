Feeling so related and engaged in the spirit of some of Robber's songs, of which _IKIGAI_ is one, I had to purchase right away a Sony headphone with noise canceling to chill in it.

Breaking my neck along these songs together with typically a can of energy drink per day has brought me a non-stop motivation to focus on my goals. As an engineering curiosity, a question about how Bluetooth has helped the audio coming from PC or phone to this headphone resulted in me creating this markdown, recording the fun things as I research along this question.
